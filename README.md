# Brain Tumor Segmentation
This project focuses on developing a model for the segmentation of brain tumors using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The goal is to create a system capable of accurately identifying and outlining tumor regions within MRI scans.

##Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles MRI image loading, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: Employs a deep learning architecture (U-Net) specifically designed for medical image segmentation.
- **Training and Validation**: Trains the model on a labeled dataset and validates its performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Segmentation Output**: Generates segmented images highlighting the tumor regions.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses the model's accuracy using metrics such as Dice coefficient.
##Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning Framework**:  PyTorch.
- **Medical Image Processing Library**: nibabel.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
